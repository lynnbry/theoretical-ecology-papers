# Comments on Gupta et al. 1996 and Luksza et al. 2014

Gupta: 
Modeled an infectious disease that has 2 loci at 2 different alleles, ax and by. Depending on cross protection of allele – ie whether someone immune to ax has protection against ay or bx – either resulted in all four recombinations persisted equally, or just the original ax and by strains persist.
Authors also compared their results to a phenomenon observed in N. meningitidis, where specific recombinations of the bacterium where more prolific than others. 
I’d push back on the idea that they ‘tested the model,’ however, given they didn’t compare their simulated data directly with collected data. Rather it was merely a demonstration of the phenomenon in real life. 

Luksza:
Used clades of influenza instead of strains to model evolution of the virus (clades being a cluster of strains with a common ancestor with up to 5 years of history). Clades were based on epitope and non epitope characteristics. Year to year predictions were highly accurate when compared to data. Further, predictions could be used to inform vaccine strain choices (although I would argue the figure they created for vaccine selection was not intuitive to understand, grumble grumble). 
Similar to Gupta, this model considers cross-immunity as a factor for strain evolution.
